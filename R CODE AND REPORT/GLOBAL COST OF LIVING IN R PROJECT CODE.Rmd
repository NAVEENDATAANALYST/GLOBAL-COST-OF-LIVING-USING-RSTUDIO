## TITLE: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF LIVING IN CANADA

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Our main goal in analyzing the data sets comes down to see how multiple variables in a data set affects each other. As we already saw by analyzing cost of living and quality of living differs greatly cities to cities when compared on large scale data like healthcare, expenditure etc. Then we take the whole world for comparison on GDP basis while coming down to focus on a single country like Canada because many factors play role in its statistics being one of the highest in the world.

OBJECTIVES:

GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding and promptly take necessary action. It also allows policymakers, economists, and businesses to analyze the impact of variables such as monetary and fiscal policy, economic shocks, and tax and spending plans.

Health-related quality of life (HRQL) focuses on the impact of health on a person's ability to live a fulfilling life. HRQL represents a broad concepts of physical, psychological with social functioning and well-being that includes both positive and negative aspects.

Government spends a considerable portion of its income towards provision of social security benefits such as unemployment allowances old age pension, insurance benefits, sickness benefit, medical benefit, etc. Such benefits reduce the desire to work. In other words they act as disincentive to work.

***
ANALYSIS:

Gross domestic product tracks the health of a country's economy. It represents the value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period within a country's borders. Economists can use GDP to determine whether an economy is growing or experiencing a recession. Investors can use GDP to make investments decisionsâ€”a bad economy often means lower earnings and stock prices. Healthcare expenditure can result in better provision of health opportunities, which can strengthen human capital and improve the productivity, thereby contributing to economic performance. It is therefore important to assess the phenomenon of healthcare spending in a country.

READING THE DATA AND GIVING A DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA.

Analyzing global per capita GDP provides insight into global economic prosperity and developments.
Small,rich and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP.

WHEN THE NA VALUES ARE PRESENT IT SHOULD BE CLEANED USING ANY OF THE CLEANING METHODS. AND HERE NA.OMIT IS USED.

```{r}


df3 <- read.csv('GDP_World.csv')
dim(df3)

sum(is.na(df3)) #THERE ARE NA VALUES PRESENT USE COMPLETE.CASES AND CLEAN THE DATA
df3_clean <- na.omit(df3)
sum(is.na(df3_clean)) #DATA IS CLEANED
dim(df3_clean)

View(df3_clean)

```

***
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THE SITUATION OF MANY COUNTRIES COMPARED TO THE MEAN VALUE OF GDP AND GDP PER CAPITA

```{r}
#STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

summary(df3_clean)
#YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MAX GDP PER CAPITA IS 132701 AND LUXEMBOURG IS HAVING THE HIGHEST GDP PER CAPITA AND MEAN GDP PER CAPITA IS 9675 WHICH SHOWS THATS THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES LYING UNDER THE MARGIN GDP PER CAPITA AND THE MINIMUM GDP PER CAPITA IS 17.12 WHICH SHOWS THAT COMBODIA IS HAVING THE MINIMUM GDP PER CAPITA 

```

MANIPULATING THE DATA FOR THE VISUALISATION.
ANALYZING AS PER YEAR AND COMPARING WITH PREVIOUS YEARS.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS HOW IN RECENT YEARS THE MEAN GDP CHANGED EITHER INCREASED OR DECREASED. AND IT SHOWS THAT WHAT COUNTRY IS HAVING MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM GDP.

```{r}

DF1 <- subset(df3_clean,df3_clean$Year==2018)

#MEAN VALUE IS 14498 WHICH IS AVERAGE GDP PER CAPITA COMPARED TO MAXIMUM GDP PER CAPITA

#WORLD GDP IN THE YEAR 2022 WITH THE YEAR 2018
df4 <- subset(df3_clean,df3_clean$Year==2022)
summary(df4)
#YOU CAN SEE THAT MEAN GDP PER CAPITA IS INCREASED OVER THE YEARS

DF <- subset(df3_clean,df3_clean$Year==2024)
summary(DF)
#IT SHOWS THAT THERE WILL BE A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MEAN GDP PER CAPITA WHICH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME GOOD DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN MANY COUNTRIES

CONCLUSION:

Our findings suggest that, in general, there is a positive association between healthcare spending and the economic indicators of labor productivity, personal income, per capita GDP, and other spending. Also, personal healthcare spending adversely impacts time spent on purchases of goods and services.Different states require varied investment in personal health expenditure, even if they have the same level of labor productivity. Overall, the study contributes to the growing literature on healthcare expenditure and economic performance. It outlines how the government can allocate healthcare expenditure in key dimensions that can stimulate economic growth while also improving the well-being of the population. It is also critical that policy makers implement appropriate policies at the macroeconomic levelâ€”targeted at public health expenditure and economic development. Overall, in light of the potential benefits of healthcare to the economy, universal access to healthcare is an area that warrants further research.
